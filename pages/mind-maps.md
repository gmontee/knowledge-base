GRINDE method

**Grouped**
- should be aiming to organizing them into groups/boxes, simplifies the knowledge, grouping into categories
 
**Reflective**
- Notes should be reflection of what's going on in your mind. A mirror. Non-linear

**Interconnected**
- connecting grouping ideas & categories of information, make new and distant connections

**Non-verbal**
- use more creative method of expression, cut down words over time

**Directional**
- arranging connections in a specific order  (e.g., A + B -> C -> E + F -> J -> feeds back into B)
- Flow, cause and effect relationship, logic
- a clean, well-organized mind produces a well-flowing mindmap

**Emphasized**
- reduce cognitive load on technique, make it habitual, focus on learning
- main points are easy to identify
- forces you to be very clear and explicit about what is the most important
