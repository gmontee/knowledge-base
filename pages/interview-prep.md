Tell Relevant Stories**

 You may have heard this positioned as different acronyms:
- STAR – Situation Task Action Results
- CAR – Challenge Action Results
- SOAR – Situation Obstacles Action Results
- PAR – Problem Action Result

 No matter what you want to call it, these all are about storytelling. Storytelling sells – as long as you’re telling the right story to the right audience.  Read the room before you get there. What is important to the audience? What skills, accomplishments, abilities, etc. are they looking for that will tell them if you can do the job. Then you can put together some good stories. Stories that **_PROVE_** your value and line up with what's important to them.

 Every good story has a beginning, middle, and end.
- Beginning: what’s going on, why was there a need, what happened to kick start the story?
- Middle: here’s the action piece, who was involved, what happened, what was done, and how?
- End: we need closure and this is it, our story ends with how everyone got their happy ending (results)

Of course, the happy ending could be a matter of a learning experience, if something did not go well.

Over the years, I’ve gone through a LOT of interviews for software engineering roles. Here’s what I’ve learned

Step 0: Where the jobs at? Stay away from LinkedIn, Indeed, or any other large job board. They give an awful ROI on time. Why? 1. They get tons of applications, you're unlikely to even get a response. 2. They require cover letters or other boring form fillers.

What should you do instead? Flip the script. Let companies find you. Sign up for services like Hired, AngelList, Woo(dot)io. You fill out a profile with your skills, job preferences, etc. and boom, companies reach out to you. No cover letters, no forms, no not hearing back.

Recruiters can also be very helpful. I've found they reach out via LinkedIn. Some are great, some are awful. Find a couple you like and stick with them - they can be your partner for years to come. They also know the industry (expected pay, companies hiring rapidly, etc).

So you're starting to get some requests for interviews, now what? Vet the companies for serious red flags. Go to Glassdoor and see if there are 17 rounds of interviews, a crazy CEO, financial struggles, etc.

No red flags - great. Let's move on. There are typically 3 steps in every interview process, but the number of rounds varies. Typically: Step 1: Intro call (~30 min) Step 2: Technical round(s) - usually 1-3 rounds (1-3 hours unless take home) Step 3: Final/Super day (2-5 hours)

Step 1: Intro call This will usually be with a recruiter, but can be with the Head of Engineering or CTO at a small startup. They are vetting you to see if you're normal, a decent fit, and excited. No red flags of your own? Great, you're onto the next round.

Tips for making this round a breeze: - Be calm and conversational - people can hear stress and lack of confidence in your voice. - You'll be asked about your resume. Turn it into a story about you. 2 minutes maximum!

- They will ask what you're looking for in your next role. Have a couple of answers. Examples: - Want to contribute to product roadmap - Want to work with X and Y technology - Want to be part of a company that is changing the industry for *climate change/musicians/athletes*

- Be kind and engaging, but don't overdo it. Be genuine. - Have a few questions for them. Could be about the team, culture, tech stack, etc. This is a must. - DEFINITELY ask what the interview process is like. 8 rounds? No thanks.

The more calls you do, the easier it will get. After ~5 of these calls, you should feel automatic.

Step 2: Technical round(s) This round has a lot of variance and can be tough to prep for. You will typically see either live coding assessments and/or a take home assessment. Find out which you prefer and seek those out. Performing in these interviews is a learned skill.

The best way to get better at handling technical interviews is to use services like Leetcode. Practice, practice, practice. Patterns will emerge. Example: loop through array, find and print the maximum occurrence of some string. Answer: Use a hash.

KEY: In live technical assessments, it is absolutely imperative that you train yourself to stay calm. When you get nervous, your brain freezes and you can't think clearly. Practice with self-imposed pressure. Seriously.

(Optional) I ask the interviewer if it matters whether I communicate or not. I hate talking while I code, so if it doesn't matter, I only talk when asking for help or a second opinion. Talking can work to your advantage though. It shows you can be a communicative teammate.

Final round: Congrats! Getting this far isn't easy, so pat yourself on the back. Final rounds are typically one full day of interviews lasting anywhere from 2-5 hours.

You will have a mix of technical and personal interviews. For the non-technical portions, you may meet with product, design, marketing, etc. Try speaking in their language. They want to see if you can communicate outside of code and if you'd be fun to work with. Be curious.

Examples: for someone in design, ask how they work with product to design new features. Is it data-driven? Is it collaborative? Do they build an MVP first?

The technical portion of the final round will most likely have some combination of algorithms, data structures, white boarding, system designs, etc. There are resources online for all the above, but again, Leetcode will help here. Like previous rounds, make sure to stay calm.
