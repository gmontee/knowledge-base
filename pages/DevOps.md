Different Types of “DevOps Teams” - Based on my experience.

Most organizations tag people dealing with Infrastructure/CI-CD as “DevOps Engineers.” and make them part of a “DevOps team.” However, their duties vary depending on the teams they work for.

There is a misconception about “DevOps Engineers” thinking they are responsible for everything. That’s not true. It might work for small teams.

In reality, If you are hired as a “DevOps Engineer,” you might fall into any one of the following teams in an organization.

1. Central Platform Team: Responsible for provisioning Infrastructure on demand. This team is responsible for delivering a scalable platform when requested. They will not take care of applications but the underlying platforms. They will make sure the production systems are available 24×7 through continuous platform support and monitoring. Also, they will work on new tooling and automation to meet future needs. The end consumers of this team would be a development or App Ops team. So this is more of shared responsibility.

2. DevOps Team: Although “DevOps team” doesn’t make any sense, organizations use it to tag the operations team with this name. This team normally works with developers closely and serves multiple development teams. They are responsible for end-to-end application delivery.

3. AppOps Team: This team is part of specific engineering teams working closely on a specific program in an organization with good knowledge of that particular domain. For example, the payments team. This team is responsible for deploying and managing payment applications. Platform management will be taken care of by the central platform team or by DevOps teams.

4. SRE Team: This team deals with automation, availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning. They work closely with developers to solve operational issues. This team consists of engineers working on infrastructure with a development background.

5. Dedicated Support Team: Support teams are meant to troubleshoot/handle production support tickets and direct the respective team’s issues based on the severity. This team has further L1, L2, and L3 level classifications.

For experienced candidates, It is very important that you understand the nature of day-to-day tasks before you join an organization. 

This post is to help engineers to ask the right questions to recruiters before falling into the "DevOps Engineer" Trap.

Also, many companies are hiring engineers for support work in the name of "SRE".

You don't want to sit and solve tickets when you are actually hired for automation work. Do you?

Also, I would like to know your experiences as a DevOps engineer? When you got hired, did you get the work you expected or promised?
