Towards a definition of "Software Architecture"
- Cross-cutting concerns: logging, exception handling, etc
- Security: authentication, authorization, confidentiality of sensitive data, etc
- Performance, scalability, availability, and other quality attributes
- Audit and other regulatory requirements
- Real-world constraints of the environment
- Interoperability/integration with other software systems
- Operational, support, and maintenance requirements
- Structural consistency and integrity
- Consistency of approaches to solving problems, and implementing features across the codebase
- Evaluating that foundations you're building will allow you to deliver what you set out to deliver
- Keeping an eye on the future, and changes in the environment

Enterprise Architecture
Strategy rather than code, about breadth rather than depth
How to organize and utilize people, process, and technology to make an organization work effectively and efficiently
